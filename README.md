# Aspire

#This is a website where the user sets up a to-do list for homework and projects. If the user completes a task they will get rewarded with xp so that they can level up and get achievements. It will motivate the user to complete their tasks by seeing their progress and help them not fall behind. The website will have a login with a user authentication. As the student completes more assignments they will level up.
